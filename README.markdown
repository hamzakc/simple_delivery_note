Simple Delivery Note
======================

I needed a simple solution to print a delivery note for a Spree 0.11 site we have.  I know it is legacy but the site is running fine so no need to update it at the moment.

Once the extension is installed you will see a Delivery note link in the sidebar when viewing an order in the admin interface.  I have assumed that your logo is called "logo.jpg", this can easily be changed in the view.
